# Predicting Electricity Consumption using ARIMA and Deep Learning

The dataset consists of hourly electricity consumption for the year 2016. The dataset has
8784 rows and an exogenous variable, hourly temperature in degrees celcius.

The following models are considered to predict the hourly electricity consumption:

1. ARIMA
2. SARIMA
3. Univariate LSTM
4. Multivariate LSTM
